# Jack-The-Giant
The focus of our project is to design a game using unity game engine. The player plays as a
giant, who is on the beanstalk. The giant has to descend down the beanstalk avoiding the
obstacles constantly. Obstacles might be an open space or the thunder cloud. The giant
should take help of the clouds to descend down. The giant dies if he does not land on the
cloud. The lower he gets or the more he lands on a cloud, the more he is rewarded with gold
coins. To make this game more fun for the players, we have added three different difficulty
levels; easy, normal, and hard. The difference in the difficulty levels are the distance between
the consecutive clouds and the pattern of their occurrence. The hard level has greater distance
between the clouds and the pattern of the occurrence of the clouds is not repeated.

The game is designed for a cross platform environment like Android, WebGL, and Windows.
In our project we have used multiple built-in functions that unity game engine provides to
make the animation smooth. We have worked on the tiniest of the details to make the giant,
the props, and the background look more realistic.
